# Data Storytelling

In this project I do some light investigation into a data set of nutrition facts of Starbucks beverages. The dataset comes from Kaggle and can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu). The purpose of this assignment is to practice my storytelling skills on a data set. To that end, I will do a modest amount of exploratory analysis to learn something about my data set, so that I may practice presenting my findings. The best data analysis is useless if you cannot communicate your findings to different audiences.

All work was done in a jupyter notebook.
